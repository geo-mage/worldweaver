## Procedure

Once you have all the prerequisites, extract the code of this program somewhere.

Then, open Blender, go to Edit->Preferences->Add-ons.

Then, click "Install", go to the folder where the program code is and select "module_mage_procgen.py".

This registers it as a blender add-on, and you will be able to start it just by pressing a shortcut.
