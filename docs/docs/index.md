# MAGE Procgen Documention 

MAGE Procgen is a Blender add-on that takes geographical data and uses them to create a 3D scene, 
generates a flood and then produces annotated images from that scene.

It currently only works on mainland France, but has a lot of parameters to customize the window, assets, and flood.
