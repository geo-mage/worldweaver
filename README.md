# WorldWeaver

WorldWeaver is a [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) plugin to create virtual worlds based on a mix of open geodata and procedural generation.
Currently, WorldWeaver only supports open data from [IGN](https://geoservices.ign.fr), the *French National Institute of Geographic and Forest Information*.

## Setup

WorldWeaver has been tested successfully with Blender 3.6 (LTS) and Blender 4.1. While it should support later versions, use at your own risk!

For practical details on how to setup the plugin, read the documentation.
